This methodology employed the CSC reporter in combination with the high-throughput imaging-based analyses for in vitro tumorigenic assay, and anticancer drug cytotoxicity testing in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). We provided [step-by-step experimental methodology in protocol.io](https://www.protocols.io/private/ECE27AC5049811EFBE540A58A9FEAC02), simple R-based programming tutorial for both assays.

## Installation requirements
R 
R studio 

See the [documentation] (https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) for R and R studio installation details.

## Usage
For the analysis tutorial composed of 3 main coding parts.
1. Evaluating the in vitro tumorigenicity of cancer stem cell candidate using the 3D multi-spheroid model: [Material, ](https://github.com/KuchikiNamthip/3D_CSCimaging/tree/0ffb0d737fb03d0c062b0704eece000711ecf6ee/1_InVitroTumorigenesis)[Tutorial](https://kuchikinamthip.github.io/3D_CSCimaging/1_InVitroTumorigenesis/script/1_InVitroTumorigenesis.html) 
2. Evaluating CSC content and cytotoxicity under anticancer drug treatments for the 3D multi-spheroid model: [Material, ](https://github.com/KuchikiNamthip/3D_CSCimaging/tree/0ffb0d737fb03d0c062b0704eece000711ecf6ee/2_3D-CytotoxicityEvaluation)[Tutorial](https://kuchikinamthip.github.io/3D_CSCimaging/2_3D-CytotoxicityEvaluation/script/2_3D-CytotoxicityEvaluation.html) 
3. Comparing cancer stem cell (CSC) content among cytotoxic drugs across a range of spheroid viability index: [Material, ](https://github.com/KuchikiNamthip/3D_CSCimaging/tree/0ffb0d737fb03d0c062b0704eece000711ecf6ee/3_CompareCSCcontent_amongDrugs)[Tutorial](https://kuchikinamthip.github.io/3D_CSCimaging/3_CompareCSCcontent_amongDrugs/script/3_CompareCSCcontent_amongDrugs.html)
